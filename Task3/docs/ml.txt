Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make decisions based on data. ML is divided into several types:

1. Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data. Example algorithms include Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.

2. Unsupervised Learning: The model learns from unlabeled data. It identifies patterns or clusters. Example algorithms include K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties. Example algorithms include Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN).

Important concepts in ML include:
- Dataset: A collection of data points used for training and testing.
- Features: Input variables used by the model.
- Labels: Output values or target variables.
- Training: Process of teaching the model using data.
- Testing: Evaluating the model on new data.
- Overfitting: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data.
- Underfitting: When a model cannot capture the underlying pattern of the data.
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall: Metrics used to evaluate models.

Machine Learning is widely used in many applications such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.
